# python-file-handling-assignment
A program that makes it simple to manage student data and retrieve it from files when needed by enabling users to add, edit, remove, display, and save student records with grades.

# My learning experience
I didn't know what to do when I first started coding this program.  I had to learn how to file handling in Python on my own because I had no prior knowledge of it or any ideas how it works. It only took me a day without sleeping to figure it out, somehow. To be honest, Python's file handling is easier than Java because it's like writing in english.
